Hi, I'm Ziyang Zheng (郑紫阳). I am currently a Frist-year Ph.D. student in the CURE Lab at The Chinese University of Hong Kong guided by Pro. Qiang Xu. Before this, I majored in  Data science and Big Data and got my bachelor's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology(ShenZhen).

I have a broad interest in Multimodal Learning, Diffusion Model and AI for Electronic Design Automation. I am open to possible cooperation opportunities and I'm glad to communicate and collaborate with students majoring in AI or EDA. Please do not hesitate to contact me via email at 1155209933@link.cuhk.edu.hk.
