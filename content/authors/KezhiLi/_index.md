Hi, I'm Kezhi Li (李柯志). I am going to be a first-year Ph.D. student in the CURE Lab at The Chinese University of Hong Kong supervised by Prof. Qiang Xu. Previously, I worked with Prof. Ming Yang and Prof. Yeqiang Qian in the Department of Automation of Shanghai Jiao Tong University on the 3D vision by LiDARs during my undergraduate.

My research interests are embedding advanced AI tools in real-world difficulties. Specifically, I am exploring the methods to extract aligned features from multi-modalities of different stages during the Electronic Design Automation (EDA). The final goal is to equip the Large Circuit Model with the ability to understand the essence of computation. If you are interested, feel free to contact me via my email.
