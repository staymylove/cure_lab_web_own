Hi, I am Yi Liu (刘奕). I am currently a second-year Ph.D. candidate in the CURE Lab at The Chinese University of Hong Kong supervised by Prof. Qiang Xu. Before this, I got my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, supervised by Prof. Baoyuan Wu.

Currently, I am working on the Large Circuit Model (LCM) project. Specifically, I am responsible for RTL representation learning and alignment. I am also interested in applying AI for EDA and combinatorial optimization (e.g., SAT problem).
