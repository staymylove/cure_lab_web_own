I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the CURE Lab at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of Professor Qiang Xu. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, with minors in Mathematics and Business, from the University of Rochester. Prior to joining CURE, I had the pleasure of working at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) with Professors Mirco Ravanelli and Maurizio Omologo, at the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute - Mila with Professors Mirco Ravanelli and Yoshua Bengio, and at the ROC-HCI Lab with Professor Ethan Hoque.

My research interests focus on the trustworthiness of artificial intelligence systems, emphasizing the enhancement of robustness and reliability in long-chain reasoning within sequential generation models.
