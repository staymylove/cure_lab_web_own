Hi, I am Ruiyuan Gao (高瑞元), a final year PhD at CURE lab of CUHK. My supervisor is Prof. Qiang Xu. Before joining CUHK, I worked with Prof.Hailong Yang and Prof.Xianglong Liu at Beihang University, Beijing, and received a B.E. degree in computer science and technology from Shenyuan Honors College in 2020. My current research interests span data generation, including generative models and synthetic data for perception tasks; and trustworthy AI, including adversarial attack/defence and AI privacy.

I am looking for jobs starting from Fall, 2025. Please do not hesitate to contact me!
