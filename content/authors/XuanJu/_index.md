Hi, I'm Xuan Ju (鞠璇). I am currently a second-year Ph.D. candidate in the CURE Lab at The Chinese University of Hong Kong guided by Prof. Qiang Xu. Before this, I majored in Computer Science and Technology (minored in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics) and got my bachelor's degree from Tongji University.

I have a broad interest in most areas of computer vision, especially in video & image generation and human motion understanding. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at juxuan.27@gmail.com !
